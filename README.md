## The main idea
Everyone want to be healthy and tactful. To this end, we usually record to the fitness club. Therefore, the task of registering a fitness club is very relevant today. You can easily learn about new lessons and sign up for them. You also do not need to remember the time at which you have scheduled classes. You just need open the application and get the right information from there.

### Features
1. The user can register.
2. The user can manage a personal schedule: enroll or unsubscribe from classes.
3. The coach as a moderator can delete, add and change classes.
4. The user can see the amount that he must pay for all classes.
5. Easy search for lessons and filtering by categories.
